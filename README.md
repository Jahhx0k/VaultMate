# VaultMate
VaultMate is a local-first password manager with a built-in password strength analyzer. It encourages better password hygiene by evaluating password entropy, reuse, and exposure (using HaveIBeenPwned APIs). It runs securely offline with optional cloud sync encryption using user-provided keys.
